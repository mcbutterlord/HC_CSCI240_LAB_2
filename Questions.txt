Intro to Programming Lab 2 – In Python Input, Output and Assignment

For this lab use Replit. Completing each question in the set.

1)      Prompt the user for their name.  Read the name.  Output “Hello “, followed by their name.
                Sample run:
                                Enter your name: Bob
                                Hello Bob

2)      Prompt and read two real numbers from the user.  Calculate and display the sum, difference and product of the two numbers.

                Sample run:
                                Enter first number: 12.5
                                Enter second number: 4.5
                                Sum: 17
                                Difference: 8
                                Product: 56.25

3)      Prompt and read two whole numbers from the user.  Calculate and display the sum, difference and product of the two numbers.

                Sample run:
                                Enter first number: 12
                                Enter second number: 4
                                Sum: 16
                                Difference: 8
                                Product: 48

4)      Write a program that prompts the user for the Fahrenheit temperature, converts to Celsius and prints the result.

Sample run:
                                Enter Fahrenheit temperature: 212
                                Converted to Celsius: 100

5)      Write a program that prompts the user for the days rented and miles driven in order to calculate the car rental fee.  The business rule that defines the fee:
                Total Fee is $49.50 for each day rented plus $.09 per mile.

Sample run:
                                Enter days rented: 4
                                Enter miles driven: 459
                                Total Fee: $239.31

6)      Write a program that prompts the user for the amount of change (0 – 99) and calculates the correct (fewest number of coins) number of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies to return as change. 
Hint: Be sure to use a whole number (int) type for all variables.  Use Div (// with int types) and Mod (%) operators.

                Sample run:
                                Enter total change: 87
                                Quarters: 3
                                Dimes: 1
                                Nickels: 0
                                Pennies: 2

 7) Complete the snowman, add body, buttons, and arms.
